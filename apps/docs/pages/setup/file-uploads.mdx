# File Uploads

## Uploadcare

To avail of Uploadcare's free plan, sign up for a free account at [Upload Care](https://uploadcare.com/). This plan allows for up to 3000 uploads every month. If you need to upload non-image files, you can easily add a payment method to your Uploadcare account without upgrading from the free plan.

### Steps

Start by creating a basic form using Formzillion.

```html copy
<form action="https://formzillion.com/f/your-form-id">
  <label for="name">Name</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name" placeholder="Name" required="" />
  <button type="submit">Send</button>
</form>
```

To incorporate the Uploadcare widget into your HTML file, it is recommended to place it within the head section.

```html copy
<script src="https://ucarecdn.com/libs/widget/3.x/uploadcare.full.min.js"></script>
```

To incorporate an upload feature, create a hidden input element and designate its role as "uploadcare-uploader". Then, include your Uploadcare public key as the value for the "data-public-key" attribute.

```html copy
<label for="image">Name</label>
<input
  type="hidden"
  id="image"
  name="image"
  role="uploadcare-uploader"
  data-public-key="your-public-uploadcare-id"
/>
```

### Example

```html copy
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta
      name="viewport"
      content="width=device-width, user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"
    />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />

        type="hidden"
        id="image"
        name="image"
        role="uploadcare-uploader"
        data-public-key="ec75cecb2431ad84b8e3"
