# Add Subscribers to Mailchimp

When you connect your form to a Mailchimp account, every time someone submits the form, they'll become a fresh subscriber in your Mailchimp account. We'll gather their name, phone number, address, and any other details provided on the form, and create a new subscriber entry in your Mailchimp account.
