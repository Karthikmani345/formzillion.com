# Add Subscribers to Convertkit

By connecting your form to a ConvertKit account, whenever someone completes the form, they will be enlisted as a fresh subscriber in your ConvertKit account. We will gather their name, phone number, address, and any additional details provided in the form to generate a new subscriber record within your ConvertKit account.
