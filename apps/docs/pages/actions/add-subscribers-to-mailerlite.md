# Add Subscribers to Mailerlite

When you link your form to a MailerLite account, each time someone fills out the form, they'll be added as a new subscriber in your Mailerlite account. We'll collect their name, phone number, address, and any other information available on the form and create a new subscriber record in your MailerLite account.
