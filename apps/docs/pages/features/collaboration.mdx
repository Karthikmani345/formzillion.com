# Collaboration

Formzillion offers several collaboration features that make it easy to work with others on your forms and data, whether you're on the same team or just sharing a form. These features include teams and sharing.

## Teams

Teams in Formzillion are groups of users who have access to the same forms and data. By creating teams, you can collaborate with your team members on form design, submissions, and data analysis.

To create a team, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Formzillion account.
2. Click on the "Teams" tab in the navigation bar.
3. Click on the "Create Team" button.
4. Enter a name for your team and a description (optional).
5. Choose the members you want to add to your team.
6. Click on the "Create" button.

Now that you've created a team, you can share forms with your team members, and they can access the same data and analytics that you can.

## Sharing

Formzillion also allows you to share individual forms with others. By sharing a form, you can collaborate with others on a specific form without giving them access to all of your data and analytics.

To share a form, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Formzillion account.
2. Click on the form that you want to share.
3. Click on the "Share" button.
4. Enter the email address of the person you want to share the form with.
5. Choose the access level you want to give them (View, Edit, or Admin).
6. Click on the "Share" button.

Now the person you shared the form with can access the form and collaborate with you on it. You can also revoke sharing access at any time.
