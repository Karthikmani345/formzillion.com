## Formzillion default thank you page

Upon submitting a form, Formzillion will redirect the user to a standard thank-you page created by Formzillion.

## Custom page content

If you want to continue utilizing Formzillion's pre-existing thank you page template while making changes to the text and headers, you can access the customization feature of the Redirection Automation action.

With this feature, you can modify the `Title`, `Message`, `Button`, and `Button URL` of the default Formzillion thank you page to suit your needs.

## Custom Redirect URL

If you prefer not to send your form submitters to Formzillion's default thank-you page, you can opt to set a custom redirection URL instead.
