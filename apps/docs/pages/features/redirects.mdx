# Submission Redirects

Formzillion offers the ability to redirect users to a configured URL after they successfully submit a form. This can be useful for displaying a thank you message, directing users to a confirmation page, or any other relevant destination.

## Getting Started

To use the redirect feature, follow these steps:

- Choose the form on which you wish to enable redirects.

- Configure the form submission redirect by specifying the URL you want to redirect users to after they successfully submit the form.

- Test the form by submitting a test submission and making sure that the redirect works as expected.

## Customization Options

Formzillion offers several customization options if you want to tailor the form and redirect experience to your specific needs. Here are a few of the available options:

- Submission redirect URL: You can specify the URL you want users to be redirected to after submitting the form. This will allow you to direct users to a specific page on your website or a third-party destination.

- Submission message: You can also customize the message that's displayed to users after they submit the form on the default redirect page, such as providing a personalized thank you message or other relevant information.
