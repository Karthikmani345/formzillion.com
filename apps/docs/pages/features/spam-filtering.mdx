# Spam Filtering

The Spam Filtering feature in Formzillion helps you protect your forms from spam submissions. By using advanced algorithms and heuristics, Formzillion automatically detects and filters out spam submissions, keeping your form submissions clean and manageable.

## Enabling Spam Filtering

To enable spam filtering, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Formzillion account.
2. Click on the form that you want to enable spam filtering for.
3. Click on the "Settings" tab in the navigation bar.
4. Scroll down to the "Spam Filtering" section.
5. Toggle the switch to enable spam filtering.

Once spam filtering is enabled, Formzillion will automatically filter out any submissions that it identifies as spam.

## Troubleshooting Spam Filtering

If you're experiencing issues with spam filtering, here are some troubleshooting guidelines:

1. Check your spam filtering settings to make sure that spam filtering is enabled.
2. Verify that you have configured your spam filtering options correctly, including setting thresholds for filtering.
3. Check your form submissions to make sure that legitimate submissions are not being incorrectly flagged as spam.
4. If you are receiving spam submissions despite having spam filtering enabled, try adjusting your filtering settings or using a third-party spam filtering service.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your forms are protected from spam submissions, while still allowing legitimate submissions to come through.
